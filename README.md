# Welcome to ChildPen!

In this project, our primary focus has been on developing robust AI models to accurately analyze children's drawings for early signs of emotional distress, bullying, or developmental conditions like autism. 
We believe that the foundation of our application lies in the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. 
Therefore, while we have prioritized the development of our AI algorithms, we have temporarily set aside the application design aspect. Our rationale behind this decision is simple: we want to ensure that the core functionality of ChildPen meets the highest standards of performance before moving on to the user interface and experience design. 
Rest assured, once we have perfected our AI models, we will shift our attention to developing the user-friendly application interface.
